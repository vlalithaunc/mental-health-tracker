mental health journal


## Summary 
I have developed a simple mental health journal tailored for students. Within this application, users have the option to either log in or sign up to participate in a designated survey that gathers essential information. This survey encompasses inquiries about one's mood, sleep quality, and duration, among other factors. Additionally, the application features a dedicated resources section, offering a variety of links to valuable mental health support materials.
